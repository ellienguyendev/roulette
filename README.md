## Reflections:
If I had more time, I would definitely go back and fix a few bugs, such as game results not being kept on display after amount runs through the database. CSS credits go to: user - raymondortega

## Important
create database.js file with:
module.exports = {

    'dbName': '<yourDbName>'
};
